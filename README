jss enables you to mix javascript and css. Example:

just define a style node inside your html head and set its type to "text/x-jss". That keeps the browser from processing it as css.
In that node you can now write javascript code wrapped in processing instructions..kinda like when mixing php and html:

<style type="text/x-jss">
<?jss def 
green: "#7eff48",
roundCorners: function(radius, unit) {
   return "border-radius: " + radius + unit + ";"
}
?>

.test-class {
   color: <?jss def.green ?>;
}

.mixin-test {
   <?jss def.roundCorners("6", "px") ?>
}
</style>

The script block tagged `def` is used to define variables and functions on an object named def. That's why it uses object notation syntax.
The oneliners just reference properties on `def` and return the appropriate value.
